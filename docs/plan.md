# Development Plan for Clinical Risk Modeling with Interpretability and Bias Detection

## Overview
This project aims to build a system for clinical risk modeling that emphasizes interpretability and bias detection.

## Key Features
- Model training pipeline
- Interpretability tools (SHAP, LIME)
- Bias detection algorithms (fairlearn)
- Reporting system
- Data preprocessing

## Roadmap
1. Set up basic model framework
2. Implement SHAP for interpretability
3. Add bias detection metrics
4. Create visualization dashboard
5. Add automated testing
6. Integrate with clinical data sources

## Current Status
- Project initialized
- Basic structure in place
- Plan documented
